# RandomNumberGenerator
App created for android that allows the user to put in a limit then generate a random number in between 1 and the limit.

The build folder for this application was too large to upload to github with over a 1000 files. So to run this app you will need to create a new project in android studio then replace the corresponding folders then all you have to do is build the project.
